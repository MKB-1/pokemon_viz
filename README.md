# Pokemon Stats Vizualization & Legendary Pokemon Classification

  <p align="center">
    Webscrapped Pokemon stats from <a target="_blank" href="https://pokemondb.net/">Pokemon Database</a> and visualized data using Matplotlib. Used webscrapped data to train classification models from Scikit-learn. Built a website to showcase results.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The motivation behind this project was to try out webscrapping. I chose Pokemon stats because I used to play the games as a kid and the Pokemon database had very well structured html, which made webscrapping simple. After making a couple of charts I wondered how the stats were distributed across different Pokemon Types. After making a couple more charts, I was tempted to spin up a quick classifying machine learning model to determine whether a Pokemon was Legendary or not, based solely from its stats. Since I had already preprocessed the data, training and testing the models was straightfoward.
